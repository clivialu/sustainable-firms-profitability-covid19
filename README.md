## In Plain Language

This study explores whether companies with better sustainability performance experienced higher profitability and stability during the COVID-19 crisis.  
Using global firm-level data across developed and emerging economies, we find that sustainable firms were generally more resilient and they maintained profitability and investor confidence more effectively than less sustainable peers.  
The analysis highlights that strong governance systems and stakeholder protection further enhanced the positive link between sustainability and firm performance during the pandemic.

| # | Why it matters | What the paper delivers |
|---|---------------|-------------------------|
| **1** | **First truly global, accounting-based test of the “sustainability pays” claim.** | Examines **48 ,867 firm-years across 34 countries (2003-2021)** and shows that high sustainability performance (SP) predicts higher next-year ROA/ROE. |
| **2** | **Institutions flip the crisis payoff.** | During COVID-19, the SP→FP link **intensifies in developed economies but vanishes in emerging markets**, spotlighting the role of rule- vs relation-based governance. |
| **3** | **Cross-listing bridges the gap.** | Emerging-market firms cross-listed on European exchanges still profit from SP, implying that exposure to stronger institutional mechanisms restores the “insurance” effect. |
| **4** | **Not all ESG pillars behave alike.** | In emerging markets, **environmental performance boosts profits during the pandemic, whereas social performance’s benefit weakens**—evidence of resource-allocation trade-offs.|
| **5** | **Methodological muscle.** | Combines OLS, moderation models and **Heckman two-step selection** to tame endogeneity and reporting-bias concerns—policy-ready evidence.|

### Managerial takeaways

* **Treat sustainability as strategic insurance—if your institutional footing is strong.** In developed markets (or when cross-listed there), robust SP cushioned profitability throughout COVID-19. 
* **In emerging economies, prioritise *environmental* initiatives.** They showed clear financial upside during the pandemic, unlike social programs that strained resources. 
* **Leverage cross-listing or other external governance channels** (e.g., EU sustainable-finance rules) to import the institutional safeguards that unlock SP’s crisis benefits. 
* **Align disclosure with investor expectations.** Detailed, assured ESG reporting enhances credibility and may lower capital costs, especially where local regulations lag. :  
* **Prepare for future shocks now.** Embed sustainability into core strategy and stakeholder relations; the study shows these investments pay off when the next crisis hits—at least where supportive institutions are in place.
